===============================================================================
- add TBL Item_Ext_23_us to prevent some missing items


- need to update the NPC info packet for the source client
- finish the 7 keys quest
- is there a way to generate the QUEST_HELPER table from the EVTs?
- Low Upgrade Scroll needs to be added to DB (379221000)
- fix the [ITEM_EXCHANGE] for nIndex=35281 (rand_num==11 for abyss gem) some of
	the items like item 389004000 don't exist
- for some reason the icons aren't showing up though
- need to add second "mastered" class to the
	UISkillTreeDlg::ButtonVisibleStateSet()
- some issue (possibly movement) causes binary server to close source client
	connection
	- doesn't seem to just be movement, maybe time spent on server and
		something is overflowing?...
	-if it is  the "Too many users logged in" error, it happens whenever the server
	encounters with the error in the lua scripts from the evtconverter
- some issue with visible/invisible
	- binary Elmorad user can't see source Karus or Elmorad GM
	- sitting and standing seems to work fine though
	- souce Elmorad user can see binary Karus GM but not Elmorad GM
	- binary client is sending the /invisible /visible commands
	- source GM is always seeing the binary GM and doesn't pass through inside.
- something wrong with archer hide spell
- need to work with GetChildByID() and CUISkillTreeDlg class
- need to figure out how best to check for player class when matching class to
	spell, current checks do not work
- work on FOG in the camera class
- make enter key log into game server and select character
- issue with starting the binary client after source client
- implement the CUIQuest object for the player quests (UIVarious)
- "Reduce" doesn't seem to be implemented for items
- currently server is looking for NpcID to check distance from NPC when opening
	Inn (eventually add this back?)
- will need to update these zoneabilities for all the 1298 zones
	- the zoneability information gets set based on the DB ZoneID
- issue where NPCs of opposite nation cannot be interacted with
	- CGameProcMain::OnMouseRBtnPress()
	- server-side "WIZ_ZONEABILITY" packet
	- m_zoneFlags, m_zoneType, m_byTariff, m_byMinLevel, m_byMaxLevel
- skill descriptions aren't word wrapping
- fixed so that it compiles with debug config
	- better to wait until I can start with blank new projects
- take a look at the new zone files 1298 added (ens, gev, etc.)
- support all 1068 file formats
	- requires testing of weapons and armor and stuff
- binary client doesn's show the noah user pays when they purchase something
-Issue in inventory with items name, not complet (not all items)
-Issue in box "Information" When monster attack me, write Lost X exprience points.
       -When i drop coins all is good, but example Wood staff message not working(not show)
